# Data caching and updating

The `pkgmatch` package package relies on pre-generated inverse document
term frequencies (IDFs). Inputs of text, code, or entire packages are
converted into document frequencies, and the results compared with the
pre-generated value to discern the best-matching result. The
pre-generated IDFs are calculated for the entire package suites of
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/packages),
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), and
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software).

## Local caching and updating for users

The pre-generated IDFs are downloaded whenever needed in initial package
calls. The download location is determined by [the `rappdirs`
package](https://rappdirs.r-lib.org/) as
`fs::path(rappdirs::user_cache_dir(), "R", "pkgmatch)"`. Users should
generally not need to worry about managing these data files themselves,
although the data can be safely deleted at any time, as can the entire
directory in which are stored.

To force data to be updated to the latest versions, run
[`pkgmatch_update_cache()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgmatch/reference/pkgmatch_update_cache.html).

The remote data are regularly updated, and so locally-cached data also
require regular updating. By default, if any one of the locally-cached
IDF files needed for functionality is more than 30 days old, a newer
version will be automatically downloaded. This update frequency can also
be over-ridden by setting a value like 100 days with:

``` r
options ("pkgmatch.update_frequency" = 100L)
```

If you want to ensure your data are always up to date, set an update
frequency of 1, and they’ll be updated every day. Alternatively, you can
set an enduring environment variable, typically in your `~/.Renviron`
file, to specify a fixed update frequency:

``` bash
PKGMATCH_UPDATE_FREQUENCY=100
```

If you wish to prevent any updating, set that environment variable to a
really high value, such as `1e6`.

## Data updating for developers

These package suites are constantly changing, and therefore the IDFs
also need to be regularly updated. The “pkgmatch” package includes
several files in the `/R` directory prefixed with “data-update”
containing functions which implement this updating. These functions are
intended to be used only by the developers. They are ultimately used in
[this GitHub workflow
file](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch/blob/main/.github/workflows/update.yaml)
which is automatically run every day to update all IDF data for both
CRAN and rOpenSci. The IDF data thus always reflect the current daily
state of both repositories. (Bioconductor uses a fixed-release system;
those data are updated less frequently, and only when Bioconductor
itself publishes a new release.)
