# Example applications

This vignette attempts to answer the question of why you should use the
`pkgmatch` package, by describing a couple of example applications.

## Text searches for R packages

### Using search engines

Anybody wanting an answer to the question, “*Is there an R package that
does that?*” will most commonly use a search engine. Here we’ll consider
the following example search:

> R package to return web search engine results into R as strings or
> URLs

Note that there is currently no package which does that, nor is there
likely to be, because search results are not generally retrievable via
APIs, and in the rare cases in which they are, they are always
restricted to authorized access only, and thus require API keys (and
commonly also payment).

Given that we expect no direct match, it is then not surprising that
most search engines will then deliver a [pile of links to pages on web
*scraping*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=R%20package%20to%20return%20web%20search%20engine%20results%20into%20R%20as%20strings%20or%20URLs%20r%20programming),
even though that word is not even part of the search. If you’re lucky,
[the `searcher`
package](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/searcher/) may appear in
the results, although that package does not actually return search
results (for the reasons described above it merely open links in web
browsers).

There is also an R-specific search engine,
[“rseek.org”](https://rseek.org), but even that largely fails to deliver
[any useful
results](https://rseek.org/?q=R%20package%20to%20return%20web%20search%20engine%20results%20in%20R%20as%20strings%20or%20URLs%20).
The first actual package mentioned is [the `stringdist`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringdist), which is in no
way related to our query (and even then, the link is to the R-journal
article describing the package, and not the package itself). Finally,
GitHub has excellent search facilities, and yet searching for our string
there simply returns [no results matching entire
repositories](https://github.com/search?q=R%20package%20to%20return%20web%20search%20engine%20results%20into%20R%20as%20strings%20or%20URLs&type=repositories).
Although there are huge numbers of matches in other aspects, such as
code or issues, clicking on those produces very little or no useful
information in attempting to identify repositories matching the search
string.

These search engine results illustrate the general difficulty of
searching for particular *types* of result, in our case R packages.
Search engines are inherently broad and generic, and use string
comparisons to match outputs to inputs, largely regardless of the type
of output. This means that search engines are generally poor tools for
identifying specific kinds of objects or results, and generally yield
mostly “noise” which must be extensively filtered before the desired
kinds of objects can be identified and compared.

In summary:

- Search engine results are general, and require extensive filtering to
  be useful.

### Using language models

Many people now use language model interfaces for web searching. These
use complex language embeddings to match inputs to outputs, and so will
generally be more likely to return actual R packages as outputs. Using a
language model interface (such as ‘perplexity.ai’ or similar), or “AI”
search results for,

> R package to return web search engine results into R as strings or
> URLs

will generally return results which include general web-scraping
packages such as [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org), along with more
specific packages such as
[searcher](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/searcher/) or
[googleSearchR](https://github.com/irfanalidv/GoogleSearchR).

A notable limitation of language model results is nevertheless that
training data are collated regardless of age, and so results may
frequently include old or obsolete packages (such as
[RSelenium](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) or
[RCrawler](https://github.com/salimk/Rcrawler/)). Mis-matches may also
occur, such as confusion between [google’s “serp-api” for their search
engine](https://serpapi.com/), and the R package named
[“serp”](https://cran.r-project.org/package=serp), which is completely
unrelated. There are also potential ethical ramifications of many large
language models, notably including that models capable of reproducing
code should respect licensing conditions of that code. This may prevent
models from identifying packages which were not used within their
training data due to licensing restrictions.

In summary:

- Language model results may be out-of-date
- Language model results may return false matches
- Language model results may be restricted only to packages with
  appropriate licenses

### Using ‘pkgmatch’

Compared to the true generality of web search engines or language model
interfaces, `pkgmatch` is very restricted in scope, but it overcomes
some of the limitations described above because:

- Results are always and only the names of R packages matching input
  queries
- Results are always up-to-date
- `pkgmatch` can return names of any package with a CRAN-compliant
  license

Now let’s look at how it responds to the same input query used above:

``` r
text <- "R package to return web search engine results into R as strings or URLs"
pkgmatch::pkgmatch_similar_pkgs (text, corpus = "cran")
```

    #> [1] "rjsoncons"   "RWsearch"    "readMDTable" "urltools"    "rigigbio"

Of those top five matches the [`RWsearch`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RWsearch) is directly
related, while most of the others offer search-like functionality in
specific domains, or other URL-related functionality. (And the
[‘rjsoncons’ package](https://github.com/mtmorgan/rjsoncons) is not
clearly related to our search term, but does provide a wealth of
functions related to querying and extraction.)

## Searches based on entire packages

Entire packages can also be used as input to `pkgmatch` functions. The
simplest way to do this is to submit the name of an installed package,
like this:

``` r
pkgs <- pkgmatch_similar_pkgs ("crul", corpus = "cran")
```

`pkgmatch` extracts all text from the nominated packages and uses this
to generate two sets of inverse document frequencies: both of all
package text including long-form documentation, and of package
descriptions only. Matches with other packages are based on combinations
of matches with these two data sets. The above call yields this result:

``` r
pkgs
```

    #> [1] "crul"   "vcr"    "curl"   "gargle" "civis"

Finally, the ability to pass entire packages to [the
`pkgmatch_similar_pkgs()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgmatch/reference/pkgmatch_similar_pkgs.html)
reflects the original motivation for this package, which is to provide a
useful tool for [rOpenSci’s software peer review
process](https://ropensci.org/software-review/), through enabling
editors to easily assess similarity of new submissions with all previous
rOpenSci packages.
