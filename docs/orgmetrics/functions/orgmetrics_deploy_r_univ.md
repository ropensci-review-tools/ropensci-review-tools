# Deploy a dashboard from an 'r-universe' "packages.json" file.

## Description

Deploy a dashboard from an 'r-universe' "packages.json" file.

## Usage

```r
orgmetrics_deploy_r_univ(url = NULL, dest_dir = fs::path_temp(), action = NULL)
```

## Arguments

* `url`: URL of a '.r-universe.dev' GitHub repository,
containing these two files:
1. a "packages.json" file defining the repositories contained within the
'r-universe'
1. An additional "orgmetrics-config.yaml" file generated by
[orgmetrics_generate_yaml](orgmetrics_generate_yaml).If the parameter is not specified, function is presumed to be called within
local version of an r-universe-like repository.
* `dest_dir`: A local directory where all repositories of the specified
'r-universe' will be cloned, and also where data generated for the
'orgmetrics' dashboard will be stored. The default is a temporary path, but
a permanent local path is better for local usage of this function, to avoid
re-generating the same data each time.
* `action`: One of "preview", to start and open a live preview of the
dashboard website, "render" to render a static version without previewing
or opening, or `NULL` to set up the quarto structure in the current
temporary directory without doing anything. This option is useful to
generate the dashboard structure so that it can be moved to a non-temporary
location, and deployed or previewed from there.
