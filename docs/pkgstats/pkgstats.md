# pkgstats

Extract summary statistics of R package structure and functionality. Not
all statistics of course, but a good go at balancing insightful
statistics while ensuring computational feasibility. `pkgstats` is a
*static* code analysis tool, so is generally very fast (a few seconds at
most for very large packages).

## What statistics?

Statistics are derived from these primary sources:

1.  Numbers of lines of code, documentation, and white space (both
    between and within lines) in each directory and language
2.  Summaries of package `DESCRIPTION` file and related package
    meta-statistics
3.  Summaries of all objects created via package code across multiple
    languages and all directories containing source code (`./R`,
    `./src`, and `./inst/include`).
4.  A function call network derived from function definitions obtained
    from [the code tagging library, `ctags`](https://ctags.io), and
    references (“calls”) to those obtained from [another tagging
    library, `gtags`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/). This
    network roughly connects every object making a call (as `from`) with
    every object being called (`to`).
5.  An additional function call network connecting calls within R
    functions to all functions from other R packages.

The [primary function,
`pkgstats()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats.html),
returns a list of these various components, including full `data.frame`
objects for the final three components described above. The statistical
properties of this list can be aggregated by the [`pkgstats_summary()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html),
which returns a `data.frame` with a single row of summary statistics.
This function is demonstrated below, including full details of all
statistics extracted.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this package is [via the associated
`r-universe`](https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev/ui#builds).
As shown there, simply enable the universe with

``` r
options (repos = c (
    ropenscireviewtools = "https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev",
    CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
```

And then install the usual way with,

``` r
install.packages ("pkgstats")
```

Alternatively, the package can be installed by running one of the
following lines:

``` r
remotes::install_github ("ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats")
pak::pkg_install ("ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats")
```

The package can then loaded for use with:

``` r
library (pkgstats)
```

### Installation on Linux systems

This package requires the [system libraries
`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io) and [GNU
`global`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/), both of which are
automatically installed along with the package on both Windows and MacOS
systems. Most Linux distributions do not include a sufficiently
up-to-date version of [`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io), and so it
must be compiled from source. This can be done by running a single
function, `ctags_install()`, which will install both
[`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io) and [GNU
`global`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/).

The `pkgstats` package includes a function to ensure your local
installations of `universal-ctags` and `global` work correctly. Please
ensure you see the following prior to proceeding:

``` r
ctags_test ()
```

    ## [1] TRUE

Note that GNU `global` can be linked at installation to the Universal
Ctags plug-in parser to expand the [default 5 languages to
30](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/). This makes no difference to
`pkgstats` results, as `gtags` output is only used to trace function
call networks, which is only possible for compiled languages able to
dynamically share pointers to the same objects. This is possible with
the default parser regardless. The wealth of extra information obtained
from linking `global` to the Universal Ctags parser is ultimately
discarded anyway, yet parsing may take considerably longer. If this is
the case, “default” behaviour may be recovered by first running the
following command:

``` r
Sys.unsetenv (c ("GTAGSCONF", "GTAGSLABEL"))
```

See [information on how to install the
plugin](https://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/global/global/plugin-factory/PLUGIN_HOWTO.pygments?revision=1.6&view=markup)
for more details.

## Demonstration

The following code demonstrates the output of the main function,
`pkgstats`, using an internally bundled `.tar.gz` “tarball” of this
package. The `system.time` call demonstrates that the static code
analyses of `pkgstats` are generally very fast.

``` r
tarball <- system.file ("extdata", "pkgstats_9.9.tar.gz", package = "pkgstats")
system.time (
    p <- pkgstats (tarball)
)
```

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   1.130   0.108   1.220

``` r
names (p)
```

    ## [1] "loc"            "vignettes"      "data_stats"     "desc"          
    ## [5] "translations"   "objects"        "network"        "external_calls"

The result is a list of various data extracted from the code. All except
for `objects` and `network` represent summary data:

``` r
p [!names (p) %in% c ("objects", "network", "external_calls")]
```

These results demonstrate that many fields use `NA` to denote values of
zero. The first item, `loc`, contains the following Lines-Of-Code and
related statistics, separated into distinct combinations of computer
language and directory:

1.  `nfiles` = Numbers of files in each directory and language.
2.  `nlines` = Total numbers of lines in all files.
3.  `ncode` = Total numbers of lines of code.
4.  `ndoc` = Total numbers of documentation or comment lines.
5.  `nempty` = Total numbers of empty of blank lines.
6.  `nspaces` = Total numbers of white spaces in all code lines,
    excluding leading indentation spaces.
7.  `nchars` = Total numbers of non-white-space characters in all code
    lines.
8.  `nexpr` = Median numbers of nested expressions in all lines which
    have any expressions (see below).
9.  `ntabs` = Number of lines of code with initial tab indentation.
10. `indentation` = Number of spaces by which code is indented (with
    `-1` denoting tab-indentation).

### Overview of statistics and the `pkgstats_summary()` function

A summary of the `pkgstats` data can be obtained by submitting the
object returned from `pkgstats()` to the [`pkgstats_summary()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html):

``` r
s <- pkgstats_summary (p)
```

This function reduces the result of the [`pkgstats()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html)
to a single line with 94 entries, represented as a `data.frame` with one
row and that number of columns. This format is intended to enable
summary statistics from multiple packages to be aggregated by simply
binding rows together. While 94 statistics might seem like a lot, the
[`pkgstats_summary()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html)
aims to return as many usable raw statistics as possible in order to
flexibly allow higher-level statistics to be derived through combination
and aggregation. These 94 statistics can be roughly grouped into the
following categories (not shown in the order in which they actually
appear), with variable names in parentheses after each description. Some
statistics are summarised as comma-delimited character strings, such as
translations into human languages, or other packages listed under
“depends”, “imports”, or “suggests”. This enables subsequent analyses of
their contents, for example of actual translated languages, or both
aggregate numbers and individual details of all package dependencies, as
demonstrated immediately below.

**Package Summaries**

-   name (`package`)
-   Package version (`version`)
-   Package date, as modification time of `DESCRIPTION` file where not
    explicitly stated (`date`)
-   License (`license`)
-   Languages, as a single comma-separated character value
    (`languages`), and excluding `R` itself.
-   List of translations where package includes translations files,
    given as list of (spoken) language codes (`translations`).

**Information from `DESCRIPTION` file**

-   Package URL(s) (`url`)
-   URL for BugReports (`bugs`)
-   Number of contributors with role of *author* (`desc_n_aut`),
    *contributor* (`desc_n_ctb`), *funder* (`desc_n_fnd`), *reviewer*
    (`desc_n_rev`), *thesis advisor* (`ths`), and *translator* (`trl`,
    relating to translation between computer and not spoken languages).
-   Comma-separated character entries for all `depends`, `imports`,
    `suggests`, and `linking_to` packages.

Numbers of entries in each the of the last two kinds of items can be
obtained from by a simple `strsplit` call, like this:

``` r
deps <- strsplit (s$suggests, ", ") [[1]]
length (deps)
```

    ## [1] 9

``` r
print (deps)
```

    ## [1] "hms"        "knitr"      "pbapply"    "pkgbuild"   "Rcpp"      
    ## [6] "rmarkdown"  "roxygen2"   "testthat"   "visNetwork"

**Numbers of files and associated data**

-   Number of vignettes (`num_vignettes`)
-   Number of demos (`num_demos`)
-   Number of data files (`num_data_files`)
-   Total size of all package data (`data_size_total`)
-   Median size of package data files (`data_size_median`)
-   Numbers of files in main sub-directories (`files_R`, `files_src`,
    `files_inst`, `files_vignettes`, `files_tests`), where numbers are
    recursively counted in all sub-directories, and where `inst` only
    counts files in the `inst/include` sub-directory.

**Statistics on lines of code**

-   Total lines of code in each sub-directory (`loc_R`, `loc_src`,
    `loc_ins`, `loc_vignettes`, `loc_tests`).
-   Total numbers of blank lines in each sub-directory (`blank_lines_R`,
    `blank_lines_src`, `blank_lines_inst`, `blank_lines_vignette`,
    `blank_lines_tests`).
-   Total numbers of comment lines in each sub-directory
    (`comment_lines_R`, `comment_lines_src`, `comment_lines_inst`,
    `comment_lines_vignettes`, `comment_lines_tests`).
-   Measures of relative white space in each sub-directory
    (`rel_space_R`, `rel_space_src`, `rel_space_inst`,
    `rel_space_vignettes`, `rel_space_tests`), as well as an overall
    measure for the `R/`, `src/`, and `inst/` directories (`rel_space`).
-   The number of spaces used to indent code (`indentation`), with
    values of -1 indicating indentation with tab characters.
-   The median number of nested expression per line of code, counting
    only those lines which have any expressions (`nexpr`).

**Statistics on individual objects (including functions)**

These statistics all refer to “functions”, but actually represent more
general “objects,” such as global variables or class definitions
(generally from languages other than R), as detailed below.

-   Numbers of functions in R (`n_fns_r`)
-   Numbers of exported and non-exported R functions
    (`n_fns_r_exported`, `n_fns_r_not_exported`)
-   Number of functions (or objects) in other computer languages
    (`n_fns_src`), including functions in both `src` and `inst/include`
    directories.
-   Number of functions (or objects) per individual file in R and in all
    other (`src`) directories (`n_fns_per_file_r`,
    `n_fns_per_file_src`).
-   Median and mean numbers of parameters per exported R function
    (`npars_exported_mn`, `npars_exported_md`).
-   Mean and median lines of code per function in R and other languages,
    including distinction between exported and non-exported R functions
    (`loc_per_fn_r_mn`, `loc_per_fn_r_md`, `loc_per_fn_r_exp_m`,
    `loc_per_fn_r_exp_md`, `loc_per_fn_r_not_exp_mn`,
    `loc_per_fn_r_not_exp_m`, `loc_per_fn_src_mn`, `loc_per_fn_src_md`).
-   Equivalent mean and median numbers of documentation lines per
    function (`doclines_per_fn_exp_mn`, `doclines_per_fn_exp_md`,
    `doclines_per_fn_not_exp_m`, `doclines_per_fn_not_exp_md`,
    `docchars_per_par_exp_mn`, `docchars_per_par_exp_m`).

**Network Statistics**

The full structure of the `network` table is described below, with
summary statistics including:

-   Number of edges, including distinction between languages (`n_edges`,
    `n_edges_r`, `n_edges_src`).
-   Number of distinct clusters in package network (`n_clusters`).
-   Mean and median centrality of all network edges, calculated from
    both directed and undirected representations of network
    (`centrality_dir_mn`, `centrality_dir_md`, `centrality_undir_mn`,
    `centrality_undir_md`).
-   Equivalent centrality values excluding edges with centrality of zero
    (`centrality_dir_mn_no0`, `centrality_dir_md_no0`,
    `centrality_undir_mn_no0`, `centrality_undir_md_no`).
-   Numbers of terminal edges (`num_terminal_edges_dir`,
    `num_terminal_edges_undir`).
-   Summary statistics on node degree (`node_degree_mn`,
    `node_degree_md`, `node_degree_max`)

**External Call Statistics**

The final column in the result of [the `pkgstats_summary()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html)
summarises the `external_calls` object detailing all calls make to
external packages (including to base and recommended packages). This
summary is also represented as a single character string. Each package
lists total numbers of function calls, and total numbers of unique
function calls. Data for each package are separated by a comma, while
data within each package are separated by a colon.

``` r
s$external_calls
```

    ## [1] "base:447:78,brio:7:1,dplyr:7:4,fs:4:2,graphics:10:2,hms:1:1,igraph:3:3,pbapply:1:1,pkgstats:99:60,readr:8:5,stats:16:2,sys:13:1,tools:2:2,utils:10:7,visNetwork:3:2,withr:5:1"

This structure allows numbers of calls to all packages to be readily
extracted with code like the following:

``` r
calls <- do.call (
    rbind,
    strsplit (strsplit (s$external_call, ",") [[1]], ":")
)
calls <- data.frame (
    package = calls [, 1],
    n_total = as.integer (calls [, 2]),
    n_unique = as.integer (calls [, 3])
)
print (calls)
```

    ##       package n_total n_unique
    ## 1        base     447       78
    ## 2        brio       7        1
    ## 3       dplyr       7        4
    ## 4          fs       4        2
    ## 5    graphics      10        2
    ## 6         hms       1        1
    ## 7      igraph       3        3
    ## 8     pbapply       1        1
    ## 9    pkgstats      99       60
    ## 10      readr       8        5
    ## 11      stats      16        2
    ## 12        sys      13        1
    ## 13      tools       2        2
    ## 14      utils      10        7
    ## 15 visNetwork       3        2
    ## 16      withr       5        1

The two numeric columns respectively show the total number of calls made
to each package, and the total number of unique functions used within
those packages. These results provide detailed information on numbers of
calls made to, and functions used from, other R packages, including base
and recommended packages.

Finally, the summary statistics conclude with two further statistics of
`afferent_pkg` and `efferent_pkg`. These are package-internal measures
of [afferent and efferent
couplings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics)
between the files of a package. The *afferent* couplings (`ca`) are
numbers of *incoming* calls to each file of a package from functions
defined elsewhere in the package, while the *efferent* couplings (`ce`)
are numbers of *outgoing* calls from each file of a package to functions
defined elsewhere in the package. These can be used to derive a measure
of “internal package instability” as the ratio of efferent to total
coupling (`ce / (ce + ca)`).

The following sub-sections provide further detail on the `objects`,
`network`, and `external_call` items, which could be used to extract
additional statistics beyond those described here.

### Objects

The `objects` item contains all code objects identified by the
code-tagging library [`ctags`](https://ctags.io). For R, those are
primarily functions, but for other languages may be a variety of
entities such as class or structure definitions, or sub-members thereof.
Object tables look like this:

``` r
head (p$objects)
```

    ##           file_name               fn_name     kind language loc npars has_dots
    ## 1 R/archive-trawl.R pkgstats_from_archive function        R  95     7    FALSE
    ## 2 R/archive-trawl.R         rm_prev_files function        R  24     2    FALSE
    ## 3         R/cpp11.R               cpp_loc function        R   3     4    FALSE
    ## 4 R/ctags-install.R           clone_ctags function        R  17     1    FALSE
    ## 5 R/ctags-install.R               has_git function        R   3     0    FALSE
    ## 6 R/ctags-install.R            ctags_make function        R  27     3    FALSE
    ##   exported param_nchars_md param_nchars_mn num_doclines
    ## 1     TRUE             163        174.8571           49
    ## 2    FALSE              NA              NA           NA
    ## 3    FALSE              NA              NA           NA
    ## 4    FALSE              NA              NA           NA
    ## 5    FALSE              NA              NA           NA
    ## 6    FALSE              NA              NA           NA

The `magrittr` package has a total of 870 objects, which the following
lines provide some insight into.

``` r
table (p$objects$language)
```

    ## 
    ## C++   R 
    ##  13 857

``` r

```

    ## 
    ## function variable 
    ##       12        1

### Network

The `network` item details all relationships between objects, which
generally reflects one object calling or otherwise depending on another
object. Each row thus represents one edge of a “function call” network,
with each entry in the `from` and `to` columns representing the network
vertices or nodes.

``` r
head (p$network)
```

    ##                   file line1                  from                        to

The network table includes additional statistics on the centrality of
each edge, measured as betweenness centrality assuming edges to be both
directed (`centrality_dir`) and undirected (`centrality_undir`). More
central edges reflect connections between objects that are more central
to package functionality, and vice versa. The distinct components of the
network are also represented by discrete cluster numbers, calculated
both for directed and undirected versions of the network. Each distinct
cluster number represents a distinct group of objects, internally
related to other members of the same cluster, yet independent of all
objects with different cluster numbers.

The network can be viewed as an interactive
[`vis.js`](https://visjs.org/) network through passing the result of
`pkgstats` – the variable `p` in the code above – to the
[`plot_network()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/plot_network.html).

### External Calls

The `external_calls` item is structured similar to the `network` object,
but identifies all calls to functions from external packages. However,
unlike the `network` and `object` data, which provide information on
objects and relationships in all computer languages used within a
package, the `external_calls` object maps calls within R code only, in
order to provide insight into the use within a package of of functions
from other packages, including R’s base and recommended packages. The
object looks like this:

``` r
head (p$external_calls)
```

These data are converted to a summary form by the [`pkgstats_summary()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/reference/pkgstats_summary.html),
which tabulates numbers of external calls and unique functions from each
package. These data are presented as a single character string which can
be easily converted to the corresponding numeric values using code like
the following:

``` r
x <- strsplit (s$external_calls, ",") [[1]]
x <- do.call (rbind, strsplit (x, ":"))
x <- data.frame (
    pkg = x [, 1],
    n_total = as.integer (x [, 2]),
    n_unique = as.integer (x [, 3])
)
x$n_total_rel <- round (x$n_total / sum (x$n_total), 3)
x$n_unique_rel <- round (x$n_unique / sum (x$n_unique), 3)
print (x)
```

Those data reveal, for example, that the `magrittr` package makes 447
individual calls to 78 unique functions from the “base” package.
