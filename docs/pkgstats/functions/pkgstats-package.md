pkgstats: Metrics of R Packages


## Description

Static code analyses for R packages using the external code-tagging libraries "ctags" and "gtags". Static analyses enable packages to be analysed very quickly, generally a couple of seconds at most. The package also provides access to a database generating by applying the main function to the full CRAN archive, enabling the statistical properties of any package to be compared with all other CRAN packages.
