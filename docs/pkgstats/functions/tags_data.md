# `tags_data`

use ctags and gtags to parse call data


## Description

use ctags and gtags to parse call data


## Usage

```r
tags_data(path, has_tabs = NULL, pkg_name = NULL)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`path`     |     Path to local repository
`has_tabs`     |     A logical flag indicating whether or not the code contains any tab characters. This can be determined from [loc_stats](#locstats) , which has a `tabs` column. If not given, that value will be extracted from internally calling that function.
`pkg_name`     |     Only used for external_call_network, to label package-internal calls.


## Value

A list of three items:
  

*  "network" A `data.frame` of relationships between objects, generally as calls between functions in R, but other kinds of relationships in other source languages. This is effectively an edge-based network representation, and the data frame also include network metrics for each edge, calculated through representing the network in both directed (suffix "_dir") and undirected (suffix "_undir") forms. 

*  "objects" A `data.frame` of statistics on each object (generally functions in R, and other kinds of objects in other source languages), including the kind of object, the language, numbers of lines-of-code, parameters, and lines of documentation, and a binary flag indicating whether or not R functions accept "three-dots" parameters ( `...` ). 

*  "external_calls" A `data.frame` of every call from within every R function to any external R package, including base and recommended packages. The location of each calls is recorded, along with the external function and package being called.

## Examples

```r
f <- system.file ("extdata", "pkgstats_9.9.tar.gz", package = "pkgstats")
# have to extract tarball to call function on source code:
path <- extract_tarball (f)
tags <- tags_data (path)
```
