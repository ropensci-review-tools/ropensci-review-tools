# `pkgstats_from_archive`

Trawl a local CRAN archive and extract statistics from all packages


## Description

Trawl a local CRAN archive and extract statistics from all packages


## Usage

```r
pkgstats_from_archive(
  path,
  archive = TRUE,
  prev_results = NULL,
  results_file = NULL,
  chunk_size = 1000L,
  num_cores = 1L,
  save_full = FALSE,
  save_ex_calls = FALSE,
  results_path = tempdir()
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`path`     |     Path to local CRAN archive
`archive`     |     If `TRUE` , extract statistics for all packages in the /Archive sub-directory, otherwise only statistics for main `tarballs`  directory (that is, current packages only).
`prev_results`     |     Result of previous call to this function, if available. Submitting previous results will ensure that only newer packages not present in previous result will be analysed, with new results simply appended to previous results. This parameter can also specify a file to be read with `readRDS()` .
`results_file`     |     Can be used to specify the name or full path of a `.Rds`  file to which results should be saved once they have been generated. The '.Rds' extension will be automatically appended, and any other extensions will be ignored.
`chunk_size`     |     Divide large archive trawl into chunks of this size, and save intermediate results to local files. These intermediate files can be combined to generate a single `prev_results` file, to enable jobs to be stopped and re-started without having to recalculate all results. These files will be named `pkgstats-results-N.Rds` , where "N" incrementally numbers each file.
`num_cores`     |     Number of machine cores to use in parallel, defaulting to single-core processing.
`save_full`     |     If `TRUE` , full [pkgstats](#pkgstats) results are saved for each package to files in `results_path` .
`save_ex_calls`     |     If `TRUE` , the results of the `external_calls` component are saved for each package to files in `results_path` (only if `save_full = FALSE` ).
`results_path`     |     Path to save intermediate files generated by the `chunk_size` parameter described above.


## Value

A `data.frame` object with one row for each package containing
 summary statistics generated from the [pkgstats_summary](#pkgstatssummary) function.


## Note

Each analysis in an archive trawl spawns several unsupervised 
 processes, preventing the trawl from running in parallel. Accurate results
 can only be guaranteed by running this function as a single process.
