# rOpenSci's review tools

This package is part of rOpenSci’s suite of “Review Tools,” all of which
are hosted at
[`github.com/ropensci-review-tools`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools).
The primary tools (in alphabetical order) are:

1.  The [`autotest`
    package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/autotest) for
    “*Automatic testing of R packages*”
2.  The [`pkgcheck`
    package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck) to
    “*Check whether a package is ready for submission to rOpenSci’s
    peer-review system*”
3.  The [`pkgstats`
    package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats) which
    extracts “*Historical statistics of every R package ever*”
4.  The [`srr` package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr)
    for “*Software Review Roclets*”

These four tools are intended to be used by all those engaged or even
vaguely interested in developing packages for submission to rOpenSci’s
system for peer-review of R packages. These packages comprise an
integrated suite of tools, with this vignette briefly describing the
intended use of each component.
